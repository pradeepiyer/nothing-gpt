Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-\n[WELLS] Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.\n[RIVERA] What's the mood? What's going on tonight?\n[WELLS] Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.\n[RIVERA] And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?"}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "[WELLS] Well, I've had a chance to speak with them earlier today.

Any specific strategy or tactics that she plans on employing?\n[WELLS] Well, you know what they say, Geraldo. The prosecutor's best friend is her assistant district attorney. She was very evasive and un forthcoming about details of the case.\n[RIVERA] Ah.\n[WELLS] But then again, that's what these prosecutors do.\n[RIVERA] Alright. And now for our first guest.

They seem a bit more calm than I expected. Apparently they're getting ready to meet the prosecutor.\n[RIVERA] And what about the witness for the prosecution, Biddy Bean? I understand that there's been some change in her story?\n[WELLS] Yes. The prosecution says that she was too nervous to remember details of the incident.\n[RIVERA] That's right. A key witness and key defendant! Something's fishy here. Jane, can you tell us more about what you've learned about Biddy Bean?\n[WELLS] Well, it's not that simple... Actually, I didn't want to say anything about her until now...\n[RIVERA] Oh, Jane...\n[WELLS] Well, I think it's time to let the cat out of the bag. Biddy Bean is not going to testify. She switched lawyers.\n[GEORGE] George Washington was assassinated!\n[JERRY] Hey look at me.\n[GEORGE] Where'd you find them?\n[JERRY] In Kramer's apartment.\n[GEORGE] How did they get in there?

Jane -\n[WELLS] Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.\n[RIVERA] That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.\n[WELLS] Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.\n[RIVERA] Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?"}], "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "[WELLS] Well, I think it was the witness who testified about the overheard conversation that they have heard so much about.\n[RIVERA] What were you able to learn about this witness, from Jane?\n[WELLS] I spoke to the witness this morning. And he had a very unusual story to tell. He claimed that he was not only just a bystander, but in fact had spent three days in the hospital following a near-death experience during the robbery. Yes, he went into cardiac arrest and almost died. Apparently he still suffers from complications from that incident.\n[RIVERA] I see.\n[WELLS] And then when asked if he might have been lying in order to get sympathy from his family and friends - his response was yes - because one of them, he claims, offered him some of money that was found on his body.\n[RIVERA] Wow - incredible. Did you know anyone at all about this case before it started?\n[WELLS] Yes, actually I did. In fact I saw her in court several times before the trial began.

Her entire testimony consisted of saying she didn't know anything about it. Afterward, Janet brushed past me in the hallway and said \"Oh my god\", because she didn't believe what she had just heard.\n[RIVERA] Well thank you for your update from Latham, Jane Wells.
