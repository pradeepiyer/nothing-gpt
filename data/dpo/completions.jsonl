Are you kidding me? I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified. Of course, it matters. What if he tells his mother about me?

It's not gonna happen.\n[GEORGE] Why are you so sure of that?\n[SUSAN] Because we talked about this.\n[GEORGE] No, no, no no, wait a minute.\n[SUSAN] What do you want?\n[GEORGE] You're gonna take this back and you're gonna never speak to me again and you're gonna forget I ever had that code!\n[SUSAN] You know, this is very cowardly of you.\n[GEORGE] Then stop marrying him!\n[SUSAN] If that was the case I'd do something about it!

And let me tell you something about those family days you're not gonna have them all year. You won't have any vacations, no Christmas holidays, New Years weekend, Hanukkah, Yule Log, all of those things are gone because they're nonproductive days which means you're not getting paid for them.

We wont get back together because we dont want to?\n[KRAMER] What are you two talking about?\n[JERRY] Break ups. Break ups are like bumping into someone in the elevator.

Why dont you get him out of your life?\n[GEORGE] So whats going on with the elevator?\n[JERRY] Oh, it had to be done. It was one of those situations.\n[KRAMER] You must have gotten an astronomical deal.\n[JERRY] No, they were out.\n[KRAMER] Are they going to give you a tour before they sell the building?\n[JERRY] Uh huh.\n[KRAMER] You know, when I moved into this building I knew that elevator was in trouble.\n[JERRY] What makes you say that?\n[KRAMER] Cuz its always jamming up like that. It never goes smooth. Its one big jolt ride all the time. Plus its kinda creepy for an elevator to have a bunch of buttons. Most elevators only have three buttons - up, down and stop. They don't need all those others in there! They're just wasting space"]}

One would normally expect much more animosity between opposing counsel.\n[RIVERA] And how do you think they'll fare?\n[WELLS] Well, Geraldo I think it's all going to be kind of inevitable. If you look at the testimony of your witnesses, I believe it would be extremely difficult for them to prove a case.\n[RIVERA] You mean against these four individuals?\n[WELLS] Well yes... and one thing that could hurt them very badly is that there are no outside witnesses who can testify to the details of the event itself, because there were no other people present at the scene other than these four", "[WELLS] Well, I've had a chance to speak with them earlier today.

Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane -\n[WELLS] Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.\n[RIVERA] That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.\n[WELLS] Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.\n[RIVERA] Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?"}], "completions": ["[WELLS] Well, if you were to guess, I would say that Valerie Harper's testimony probably gave the jury pause. Not only was it the longest and most dramatic of all, but she was also so heartbreakingly tragic.\n[RIVERA] Jane, did anyone at any point during the trial say they were shocked by her story?\n[WELLS] The only reaction I witnessed today was when Janet Weiss testified in defense of one of the defendants. Her entire testimony consisted of saying she didn't know anything about it. Afterward, Janet brushed past me in the hallway and said \"Oh my god\", because she didn't believe what she had just heard.\n[RIVERA] Well thank you for your update from Latham, Jane Wells. We'll be back after this break.\n[STEINBRENNER] I don't think we've settled on a name for the baby yet. What do you think? Bobby Joe? Jack? Michael?\n[KRAMER] Well, my father's name was Leonard. You ever hear Leonard?\n[STEINBRENNER] No,\n[KRAMER] Yeah, never met him.\n[STEINBRENNER] Oh Kramer look at this card you sent to Dad...we must have torn", "[WELLS] Well, I think it was the witness who testified about the overheard conversation that they have heard so much about.\n[RIVERA] What were you able to learn about this witness, from Jane?\n[WELLS] I spoke to the witness this morning. And he had a very unusual story to tell. He claimed that he was not only just a bystander, but in fact had spent three days in the hospital following a near-death experience during the robbery. Yes, he went into cardiac arrest and almost died. Apparently he still suffers from complications from that incident.\n[RIVERA] I see.\n[WELLS] And then when asked if he might have been lying in order to get sympathy from his family and friends - his response was yes - because one of them, he claims, offered him some of money that was found on his body.\n[RIVERA] Wow - incredible. Did you know anyone at all about this case before it started?\n[WELLS] Yes, actually I did. In fact I saw her in court several times before the trial began. And she seemed a little nervous and fidgety each time she came up for her own testimony.\n[RIVERA] Oh wow, that's amazing.\n[WELLS] Yes", "[WELLS] I think the jury really connected with Tony Esposito's testimony. He is a middle-aged man who gave up his entire savings to help out his best friend. He believed that these four people were out to get him, but he never hurt anyone and still had the courage to give what he thought was a very generous gift. The jury I believe saw Tony as an honest, innocent man who was motivated by good intentions.\n[RIVERA] Are you aware of any developments that may be happening outside of this courtroom?\n[WELLS] Actually Geraldo, just last night I received word from my sources in Latham that there are rumblings about people possibly challenging some of the jurors' voting rights based on their possible disqualification for pre-jury bias.\n[RIVERA] Pre-jury bias. Well Jane, we appreciate your time here in Latham. Back here in New York, news has been coming in that the jury did return a verdict on the Good Samaritan case.\n[JUDGE] Okay, I'd like to remind everyone that this is an open court and that members of the press are welcome to leave now.\n[WELLS] Well Geraldo, thanks again for having me.\n[RIVERA] We'll have more news"]}
